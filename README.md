Summer 2022 Voting Research with Dr. LeGrand

This is mostly just a directory dump for now.

If you really want to take a look at it, start with <https://github.com/JEnduriumK/VotingResearch/blob/main/vote3Research1k.cpp>

Just know that this was a very rushed research project that had to squeeze into a tiny, eight-week period, and also included a 25+ page paper and a poster. The code isn't the best. It needs optimization, cleaning, comments, etc.
